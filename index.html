               <strong> Welcome to my website ðŸ˜‰ </strong>
               I really enjoyed creating a website for a presentation when I was in highschool so I thought creating a professionnal one could be a good idea!

            <h2>Passions</h2>
            <p>
               I love cooking so I joined the HEC cooking club in which we have fun preparing buffets for other clubs' events.
               I'm also passionnate about catamaran and I'm lucky enough to have sea trips every summer!

            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <p>
               I'm pretty interested in start ups. As the vice-president of the HEC entrepreneurship club, I've interviewed many start uppers and it was a pleasure to witness how much they enjoy what they do. I don't have a clear idea of a start up I would like to launch on my own so I would be glad to join an entrepreneurial team.
